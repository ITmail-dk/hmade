# Hmade Debian install.
> [!WARNING]
> Testing.

Hyprland Martin Andersen Desktop Environment, Hmade for short.!

Right now It's just for a test so if I were you I won't download to run it update is coming...

## Remember to install Debian without the desktop environment.
After installation Debian, Reboot the computer and login with your username and password.
Start the installation as regular users with SUDO rights, after you login to your freshly installed machine.

Run this one command to start Hmade install and you're good to go.:

    bash -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITmail-dk/hmade/main/install.sh)"

And when you are asked if you want to restart services during the installation, simply say Yes.
